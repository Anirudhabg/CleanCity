# CleanCity: Enhancing Waste Disposal and Sanitation Through Technology

## Overview

The CleanCity Application is a user-friendly tool designed to help users identify the proper disposal methods for various types of waste. By leveraging machine learning and image processing, this application allows users to upload an image of waste, which is then classified, and the corresponding disposal method is provided.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Uses a TensorFlow Lite model to classify waste types from uploaded images.
- **Disposal Methods**: Provides users with proper disposal methods based on the classification results.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Flet for an interactive and responsive user experience.
- **Lightweight**: The application runs efficiently on local machines without requiring heavy resources.

## Technologies Used

- **Flet**: A framework for building interactive web applications in Python.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: A lightweight version of TensorFlow designed for mobile and edge devices, used for running the machine learning model.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: A Python Imaging Library used for image processing.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations in Python.
