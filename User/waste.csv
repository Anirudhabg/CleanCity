Waste Type,Description
Cardboard,"This material can be recycled easily. Make sure the cardboard is clean, dry, and flattened before placing it in the recycling bin or taking it to a recycling center. Wet or contaminated cardboard cannot be recycled effectively."
Glass,"Glass should be disposed of in a designated glass recycling bin. It is important to separate different colors of glass—clear, green, and brown—since they are processed separately. Ensure the glass is rinsed and free from contaminants like food or liquids before recycling."
Metal,"Items such as aluminum cans, steel, and other metal objects should be placed in the metal recycling bin or taken to a scrap metal recycling facility. Make sure to rinse out cans to avoid contamination. Many metals, including aluminum and steel, can be recycled indefinitely without losing their properties."
Paper,"Paper is one of the most common recyclable materials. Items like newspapers, office paper, and magazines can be placed in a paper recycling bin. However, ensure that the paper is free of food stains, grease, or other contaminants, as these can affect the recycling process."
Plastic,"Plastics are usually categorized by their resin identification code (numbers 1-7), and not all types are recyclable in every location. Items like plastic bottles and containers should be placed in the plastic recycling bin. Some types of plastic, such as plastic bags, require special collection points like drop-off centers at grocery stores. Check local guidelines for specific instructions on plastic recycling."
Trash,"Non-recyclable waste, or general trash, should be placed in the regular waste bin. This includes items that cannot be recycled due to contamination or material type, such as certain types of food waste, dirty packaging, or other non-recyclable items. This waste usually ends up in landfills or incineration facilities."
